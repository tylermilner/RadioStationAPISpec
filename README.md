# RadioStationAPISpec
A RAML specification for a generic internet radio station API. The API is being developed in Swift Vapor [here](https://github.com/tylermilner/RadioStationAPI).

**ðŸš§ This is a work in progress. ðŸš§**
* The general structure of the API has been defined, but is not final.
* View the API structure by opening the included `.raml` files in your favorite text editor.
* You can also view the API in a more human-readble form [online](https://radiostationapi-dev.vapor.cloud/docs/index.html).
